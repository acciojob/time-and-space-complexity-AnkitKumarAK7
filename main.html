	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to complete its execution. An algorithm with a lower time complexity is considered more efficient, as it can perform its task in a shorter period. Developers strive to design algorithms with optimal time complexity to enhance the overall performance of their applications.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is another essential aspect of algorithm analysis, focusing on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses based on its input size. The notation used to represent space complexity is O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity means that the memory required by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration when designing algorithms, especially for applications with limited memory resources.</p>
